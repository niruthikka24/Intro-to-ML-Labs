# Introduction to Machine Learning Module Labs

## Lab 1

The first lab activity was to do data preprocessing and feature engineering on the provided dataset. 

## Lab 2

The second lab activity was to design a machine learning model to predict the electrical energy output (EP), given the attributes AT, AP, RH and V. Use your model to predict the EP for the test dataset.

### About the Dataset for Lab 2

The training dataset contains 8500 data points collected from a power station over several years. The recorded attributes in the dataset include the following hourly average variables:

* Temperature (AT)
* Ambient Pressure (AP)
* Relative Humidity (RH)
* Exhaust Vacuum (V)

This power station has gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. Here, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. While the Vacuum is collected from and has effect on the Steam Turbine, the other three of the ambient variables affect the GT performance.

## Lab 3

This lab focused on the concept of principal component analysis (PCA) to transform data into a lower dimensional space. 

Here, PCA was applied on the Fisherâ€™s Iris dataset. The data contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. There are 4 different attributes describing the data.
